Your Project's Name
COVID-19 Pastaway

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Our project is about teaching people about COVID-19. Since COVID-19 has been around for 2 years, the rules that we have to follow have also been constantly changing, so we decided that we will do a game/quiz relating to COVID-19 to teach people what we should do during these times(such as maintaining a 1M spacing between one another) and what we should not do(such as removing our mask when we are not eating/drinking). This will also help those who do not follow the news that much, as it will show them what rules have changed(number of people that can go out) and also educate them on what to do.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

Our process when it comes to designing this website is firstly, how would we as users enjoy look of the website and secondly how simple it is to navigate around it. At the start, we had issues trying to figure out how we wanted to design our website as the two of us had different ideas on what we should do, but we decided to research and watch videos for inspiration. The website focuses on anyone who needs help to know more about COVID-19 and the things we should and should not do. We want to make sure that anyone that uses this website learns more about COVID-19 and the different restrictions that constantly change so that they will obey them. Our website does not take up that much time for people to educate themselves about the restrictions and it is also fun and simple to use.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
